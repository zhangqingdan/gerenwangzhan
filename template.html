		<p>Mother lives by herself in our old house in my hometown since my sister married. Thinking mother may feel lonesome and sometimes may be a little frightened, especially at night, my sister sent a little dog in a shoe-box to mother some day. It was only about one month old at that time. When I went home not long after it got to mother 's house, I saw that poor creature . It was yellowish white. He looked so small that I could have to say he was no larger than a kitty, however downy and cuddly. Mother found a piece of cotton pad for him to lie about and asked spoonfuls of goat milk from my l neighour every day to feed him. I named him Wang-wang, a common name for dogs. From then on, mother has being kept him for years, and he may be the only one who accompanies mother all day long these years. Now he has become a big dog and a responsible house-guard and seems kind. He would bark violently as any stranges approach to the gate but never bites any one. Mother evalates of him to me: what the dog can only do is to bark and scare people and tell me someone is coming. Mother may be out sometimes,Wang-wang would sit near the door for hours waiting for  small that I could have to say he was no larger than a kitty, however downy and cuddly.

He would bark at me, too , and waving his tail happily and running and jumping around me though he might have not seen me for months..</p>
